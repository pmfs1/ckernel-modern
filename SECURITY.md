*The purpose of this policy is to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the code and to prevent unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. The policy applies to all users who have access to the code or the repository, including employees, contractors, researchers and collaborators. Therefore, it is good practice to report vulnerabilities privately to maintainers; in our case, by creating a [new security advisory](https://github.com/private-collaboration-consortium/ckernel/security/advisories/new), or, alternatively, through [private-inc.dxd4h@slmails.com](mailto:private-inc.dxd4h@slmails.com).*
